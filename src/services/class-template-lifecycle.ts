/**
 * Class Template updates — the teacher-editable boundary for
 * `PUT /api/class-templates/[id]`.
 *
 * The sibling of `class-lifecycle.ts`'s update section (#82 is #79 one route
 * over), with the same five pins. Four things deliberately differ, and are
 * worth knowing before reading this as a mirror:
 *
 *   - Ownership lives here, not in the route. `updateClass` takes no
 *     `teacherId` and its route checks ownership; this takes one and checks it
 *     itself, so the guard travels with the function.
 *   - `no_fields` is a key count here, not a defined-value scan. `updateClass`
 *     uses `Object.values(...).some(v => v !== undefined)` because a zero-count
 *     `updateMany` landed in an unreachable branch as a 500; `update` has no
 *     such branch, and the key count is what the pre-service route did.
 *   - The column pins reference the *Many* input while the write below is
 *     single-record `update`. That is a deliberate tightening, not a match.
 *   - The delete-between-read-and-write race is unhandled here. `updateClass`
 *     went to some length for it (#72); this window throws P2025 as a 500.
 *     Pre-existing, and out of scope for #82.
