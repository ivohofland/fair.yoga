 * re-read, is what closes the race (#95).
 *
 * Deliberately a second copy rather than one helper generic over a Prisma
 * delegate: the two families are kept parallel-but-separate throughout, and a
 * generic version would have to interpolate the table name into raw SQL.
 *
 * Must be called with a transaction client, never a bare `PrismaClient` — see
 * `claimTemplateForGeneration` for what that would silently break: `SET
 * LOCAL` becomes a no-op with nothing to scope to, and the row lock releases
 * the instant the `SELECT` completes. That used to mean the claim returned
 * `true` while holding nothing; it is not gone, and it now has a second
 * consequence: the `findUniqueOrThrow` below then runs unlocked too, and can
 * throw P2025 if the row is deleted out from under it before that second
 * statement runs.
 *
 * Do not weaken `FOR UPDATE` to `FOR NO KEY UPDATE` to stop blocking
 * `StudioClass` inserts — it looks like a free optimisation but isn't.
 * `FOR UPDATE` is what makes a concurrent insert for this template
 * impossible, because an insert's FK check takes `FOR KEY SHARE` on this row,
 * which `FOR UPDATE` conflicts with and `FOR NO KEY UPDATE` does not. Measured
 * on #164, both directions.
 *
 * That is a claim about races, not about correctness under one:
 * `generateStudioInstancesForTemplate` no longer has a P2002 branch to be
 * broken — the per-template generator below, not the sweep, which never had
 * one because it issues no insert of its own.
 * Its `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` makes a lost race cost one date and abort
 * nothing, with or without this lock. The lock still earns its place by
 * keeping the values this claim returns authoritative (#102).
 *
 * Returns the locked row rather than a boolean, so a caller cannot generate
 * from the snapshot its outer `findMany` read minutes earlier (#102). The raw
 * statement above still does the locking and the eligibility re-check; the
 * Prisma read below is what makes the values authoritative, and it is safe
 * precisely because the lock is still held when it runs. Two statements
 * rather than one `SELECT *` because `hourlyRate` is `DECIMAL(10,2)` and a
 * raw row does not hand back Prisma's `Decimal`.

/**
 * Generates the rolling 4-week window for ONE studio template, reporting each
 * candidate date it could not fill and why (`GenerationResult`). The studio
 * twin of `generateInstancesForTemplate` (`class-generator.ts`) — same client
 * union, same optional `from`, same result shape — so the two families can be
 * read against each other.
 *
 * Same two mechanisms as the class family:
 *
 *   - the occupancy `findMany` below names the *reason* a date is skipped,
 *     which is what lets the teacher be told something true and an operator
 *     grep for it. It is a read-then-write and so is not race-safe on its own;
 *   - `createManyAndReturn({ skipDuplicates: true })` compiles to a BARE
 *     `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` — no conflict target, so it covers every unique
 *     constraint on the table, including the partial index #196 adds:
 *     `StudioClass_teacher_slot_unique` on (teacherId, date, startTime) WHERE
 *     "cancelledAt" IS NULL. That is what makes a clash cost only its own
 *     date. Measured the same way as the class family's twin claim: this
 *     file's "names a date lost to a concurrent insert as raced, not as
 *     filled" test parks a holder row on a date/time this key also covers,
 *     and the generator's own transaction still creates the other three
 *     dates and commits rather than aborting.
 *
 * This function's P2002 hedge used to document the same 25P02 trap the class
 * family's did (#164): a caught `P2002` inside an interactive transaction
 * aborts it, and the next statement fails with `25P02`. It is gone for the
 * same reason — the hedge could not work, only quietly poison. Do not
 * reintroduce a `catch` here.
 *
 * Takes `PrismaClient | Prisma.TransactionClient` so a caller can compose it
 * into a transaction it already owns. That is the whole reason this function
 * exists: before #94 the loop was inlined in the sweep, so
 * `pauseOrResumeStudioTemplate` had nothing to call but the platform-wide
 * sweep, and left a resumed template empty until the next cron run.
